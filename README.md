## 🎤 Elevator Pitch

Before creating mynav, I often found myself frustrated when working on multiple projects using tmux, as I had to manually navigate between project directories. While tmux’s choose-tree feature allows jumping between active sessions, it relies on the tmux server staying alive and doesn't fully meet the needs of a robust workspace manager. mynav bridges this gap by combining tmux's powerful features with a workspace management system, enabling a more efficient and streamlined development workflow in a terminal environment.

## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Smart Workspace Organization**
  - Group projects into topics for better organization
  - Automatic git repository detection and status
  - Quick workspace creation and navigation

- 💻 **Advanced Session Management**
  - Seamless tmux session creation and switching
  - Live session preview with window/pane information
  - Create, modify, delete and enter sessions seamlessly

- 🎯 **Modern Interface**
  - Clean, intuitive terminal UI
  - Vim-style navigation
  - Fuzzy search functionality

- 🔧 **Developer Experience**
  - Git integration with repository status
  - Built with tmux (uses tmux for sessions)
  - Extensive keyboard shortcuts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Try with docker

```bash
docker run -it --name mynav --rm ubuntu bash -c '
        apt update &&
        apt install -y git golang-go neovim tmux curl unzip &&
        cd &&
        (curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GianlucaP106/mynav/main/install.bash | bash) &&
        export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.mynav" &&
        mkdir nav && cd nav &&
        mynav
    '
```

### One-Line Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GianlucaP106/mynav/main/install.bash | bash
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GianlucaP106/mynav.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd mynav

# Build project
go build
```

### Prerequisites

- Tmux 3.0+
- Git (optional, for repository features)
- Terminal with UTF-8 support

## 📖 Usage

Mynav requires a root directory to initialize in. You may initialize multiple directories but not nested. You can start mynav anywhere with:

```bash
mynav
```

> This will look for an existing configuration if it exists (in the current or any parent directory).

You may specify a directory to launch in using:

```bash
mynav -path /your/root/path
```

## 📺 Tmux Integration

Mynav integrates seamlessly with **tmux**, using it to manage sessions efficiently. When a session is created from a workspace, the workspace’s directory path is used as the tmux session name. This design keeps the state transparent and familiar, rather than hidden behind abstraction.

Once inside a tmux session, you can use all your usual tmux features. One key feature that enhances the mynav experience is the ability to **detach from the session** and return to the mynav interface by pressing **`Leader + D`**.

This tight integration gives you the full power of tmux while keeping mynav in sync with your development workflow.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- MyNav uses a configuration system that supports multiple independent workspaces
- MyNav looks for configuration in the current or any parent directory
- Multiple independent directories can be initialized with MyNav
- Nested configurations are not allowed (invoking mynav nestedly will simply open the parent configuration)
- Home directory cannot be initialized as a MyNav workspace

## 🛠️ Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

Mynav is a straightforward, low-configuration project that only requires the Go runtime to get started in development.
